# Tiles Game Demo Intan Interface
This is the Intan Interface for the white tiles demo for ECE202 Group 7. The purpose of this interface is to connect to the Intan software, read the EMG data frome **TWO** channels and convert to game controls, i.e. left arm = move left, right arm = move right.  

### Task List:
* [x] Read from Intan
* [ ] Calibration
    * Determine resting potential range
    * Determine threshold for "flexing" potential minimum
* [ ] Read from 2 channels
* [ ] Link to game movements

### Notes:
Recorded data is in microV for potential over seconds

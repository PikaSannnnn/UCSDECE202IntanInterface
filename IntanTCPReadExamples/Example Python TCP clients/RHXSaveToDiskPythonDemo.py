"""Example demonstrating connecting to RHX software via TCP, providing a file
location and name to save data to, and recording 5 seconds of data.

In order to run this example script successfully, the IntanRHX software
should first be started, and through Network -> Remote TCP Control:

Command Output should open a connection at 127.0.0.1, Port 5000.
Status should read "Pending".

Once this port is opened, this script can be run to ask the user for a location
to save data to, then use TCP commands to configure this save location for the
RHX software. Then, ~5 seconds of data are recorded to this save location
before stopping recording.

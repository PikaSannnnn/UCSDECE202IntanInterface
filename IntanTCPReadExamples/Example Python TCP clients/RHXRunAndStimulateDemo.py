"""Example demonstrating connecting to RHX software via TCP and controlling a
Stimulation/Recording Controller. This script sets up stimulation parameters
on a single channel, and runs for 5 seconds (stimulating 5 times in total).

In order to run this example script successfully, the IntanRHX software should
be started with a Stimulation/Recording Controller (or a synthetic
Stimulation/Recording Controller); other controller types will not work with
this script.

Through Network -> Remote TCP Control:

Command Output should open a connection at 127.0.0.1, Port 5000.
Status should read "Pending"

Once this port is opened, this script can be run to use TCP commands to
configure stimulation on channel A-010. Then, the controller will be run for 5
seconds, and every ~1 second a TCP command to trigger stimulation will be sent.
